# DiabetesPrediction
In this project, I utilized the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict diabetes based on health parameters. Chosen for its simplicity and interpretability, KNN analyzes an individual's health metrics by comparing them with their nearest neighbors, making it suitable for healthcare applications. The algorithm's adaptability allows it to discern complex relationships between health factors, offering valuable insights for early diabetes diagnosis. This approach provides transparency, crucial for healthcare practitioners in understanding and trusting the model's predictions. Overall, the project showcases KNN's effectiveness in creating an interpretable and reliable tool for predicting diabetes, aiding in timely intervention and patient care.
